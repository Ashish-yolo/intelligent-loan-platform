CRITICAL FIXES: Bank Statement Password Generation & Aadhaar Address Auto-fill

PRODUCTION ISSUES RESOLVED:
1. ✅ FIXED: Bank statement processing now uses real PAN data for password generation
2. ✅ FIXED: Aadhaar back data preservation for address auto-fill functionality
3. ✅ ENHANCED: PDF decryption with pycryptodome support for AES encryption
4. ✅ IMPROVED: Direct data passing eliminates database retrieval complexity

KEY FIXES DEPLOYED:
- Frontend sends PAN data directly with bank statement uploads
- Backend generates passwords using real extracted name and DOB
- Separate aadhaar_front and aadhaar_back data preservation
- Enhanced password variations for better decryption success
- Simplified data flow for immediate results

BANK STATEMENT PROCESSING:
- Password generation: First 4 letters + DDMM format from real PAN data
- Multiple password variations tried automatically
- Fallback uses actual user data instead of generic demo data
- Real Claude API processing with proper PDF decryption

ADDRESS AUTO-FILL ENHANCEMENTS:
- Prioritizes Aadhaar back data where address is typically located
- Multiple field name fallbacks for robust extraction
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

DEPLOY IMMEDIATELY: Core functionality fully operational
