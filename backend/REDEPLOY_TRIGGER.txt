CRITICAL FIX: Document extraction now shows REAL vs DUMMY data clearly

ISSUE IDENTIFIED: System was returning dummy data instead of real extraction!
USER FEEDBACK: "both salary extraction and pan extraction is of dummy data"

SOLUTION: Restored real Claude API integration with clear error handling
- PAN extraction: Real API calls, shows "API NOT CONFIGURED" if no key
- Salary extraction: Real API calls, shows "REQUIRES CLAUDE API" if no key  
- No more misleading dummy data disguised as real extraction
- Clear transparency about when real extraction is available

REQUIRES: Valid ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in production for real extraction
RESULT: Users will know exactly when they're getting real vs demo data

Force complete rebuild and restart of all services for transparency.
